RAVDESS is one of the more common dataset used for this excercise by others. It's well liked because of its quality of speakers, recording and it has 24 actors of different genders. And there's more! You can get it in song format as well. There's something for everyone and their research project. So for convenience, here's the filename identifiers as per the official RAVDESS website:

* Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
* Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
* Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
* Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
* Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
* Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
* Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).

So, here's an example of an audio filename. 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4
This means the meta data for the audio file is:

* Video-only (02)
* Speech (01)
* Fearful (06)
* Normal intensity (01)
* Statement "dogs" (02)
* 1st Repetition (01)
* 12th Actor (12) - Female (as the actor ID number is even)
